version 2015122018 release 1.0.3

Fixes drawer bug and footer

version 2015122008

If the editor loses focus, drop out of fullscreen. This happens if
user hit tab key.

version 2015122007

Override the disable buttons function. The html plugin was changed
in 3.6 to include htmlplus functionality. This resulted in fullscreen
being disabled when html plugin was invoked. Now fullscreen ignores all
disable requests as there is not a reason why any editor plugins should
disable it.

version 2015122006

Add support for Privacy API
Compatible with Boost 3.5 theme

version 20151220

Enable better compatibility with htmlplus plugin. htmlplus window is
dynamically resized and does not deactivate plugin.

version 20150513

Add a setting to require the capablity to arrange activities. The function
is to prevent the fullscreen option being available to students to keep
the toolbar more minimal.
